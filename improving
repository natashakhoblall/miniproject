Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration are beneficial to a company because it creates a standard platform for development processes, where developers can connect and understand each other’s work. Git helps to keep track of changes in software development. All of these areas help to improve workflow. Automated testing ensures that positive outcomes are achieved and continuous integration ensures that developers’ programming is shared. Companies can develop programs and software more efficiently and effectively by using these tools and can continue to build new programs based on previous work, ensuring that work tasks are not redundant.
