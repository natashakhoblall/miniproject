Git commands and terminology:

GitFlow-

Some key benefits include:

Parallel Development
o	One of the main things about GitFlow is that it allows for parallel development. This is done by isolating new development from finished work and making it easier to distinguish the difference between the two. New development or capability improvements are completed in feature branches and is only merged back into main code when the developer is ready to move to a production state. 
Collaboration
o	Gitflow also offers more collaboration and feature branches which makes it easier for two+ developers to collaborate on the same feature or enhancements. This process makes it easy for other developers to see and follow each collaboration effectively. 
Support For Emergency Fixes
o	GitFlow also supports something called “hotfix branches”. Essentially these hot fix branches can be useds to make an emergency change. 


Commit-

o	Task: a commit adds the latest changes to a certain part of the source code to the repository, making these changes part of the head revision of the repository.


Clone-
Git Clone essentially clones your exiting repository and split it into another branch


Fork-

o	Task: When you are Forking a repository you are creating a copy of repository under the GitHub Id. Any changes made to the original repository will be reflected back to your forked repository. However, if you make any changes to your forked repository you will have to explicitly create a pull request to the original repository. When your pull request is approved by the administrator of the original repository, then your changes will be merged with the existing original code-base. Until then, your changes will be reflected only in the copy you forked.


Merge-

git-merge - Joins two or more development histories together into one

Repository-

Local repository: It is just a file location residing on your system. When you git commit your code, a snapshot is created in your local repository
Remote repository: A remote repository resides somewhere outside your system, on a remote machine/server. This is very important when you are working with multiple people. This is the place where everyone will be sharing their code.


Master Branch-
A branch in Git is basically a small movable pointer to one of the commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you start to make commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward. 



Status-

o	Task: The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have and haven’t been staged as well as which files aren't being tracked by Git. 


Checkout-

o	Task: The git checkout command lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch. Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch.

Git Push & Pull-

Push- The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's essentially the opposite to git pull
Pull- The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.

Show, remove, Add

o	Task: essentially, manages the set of repositories whose branches you track.
o	Task: Rm Remove the remote named <name>. All remote-tracking branches and configuration settings for the remote are removed.
o	Task: Add - Adds a remote named for the repository at a certain address.
